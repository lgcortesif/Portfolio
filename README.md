# Power BI dashboards portfolio

## Introduction

This repository will store dashboards organized by thematics. Each folder is an independent folder by its own; there the raw data, the dashboard extension and other key materials will be placed. Following, each folder will be described.

### Dashboards

**1. Historic data analysis of the video games industry (Ventas de video juegos)**

<p align="justify">The previous dashboard analyzes the data collected from the selling sector of video games all over the world by different cathegories. In order to unlock the study of the data, the raw files were processed by transforming the columns by each cathegory separated. Finally, the data, allocated in one table, were classificated into five cathegories: by year, by region, by platform, by gander and by editorial.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, the dashboard shows, in a simple glance, the status over the selling situation all across the previous five cathegories and its combinations. The KPIs performed, all of them managed in a control pannel located on the top of the board, intuitively change the values of the five tied-pannels. From left to right until to the bottom, the first pannel shows the total amount of video games sold with the active cathegories. The next time-series chart shows staxking values by region by year. The next figure shows the correspondent slice-rounded area due the totals by region. The following vertical bar chart shows the same metric by region per each platfform used. Finally, in the same format the figure shows the relationship between the gender and region. At the end there is a table that collect all the data available.</p>



**2. World population demographic and social statistics (World demographic metrics)**

<p align="justify">The previous dashboard analyzes the demographic situation by country and by continent using three metrics; all of them located on the top of the board to give to the users the option to tune the metrics as a controller. The intuitiveness on the design help users to unlock the possibility to start performing the analysis as a supervisors, giving them the power to check all the situation in a simple glance.</p>

<p align="justify">At the beginning of the process, an ETL routine were placed as a door from the raw data and the data ready to be consumed by the BI board. This is the reason why new columns were added to the original tables to scale the analysis grouping numbers by range cathegories. As an example, the BI-board could show the countries, grouped by the correspondent continent, in terms of the life expectancy.</p>
